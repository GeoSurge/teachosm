        <div class="section-subheading text-muted">TeachOSM was chartered in 2016 as a project of OpenStreetMap US (OSM US) to provide operational support and strategic guidance for the educational outreach mission of OSM US.

          The TeachOSM website's purpose is to be a central location to empower and support educators at all levels to integrate open source mapping and the OpenStreetMap ecosystem of tools in the classroom. Educators are encouraged to make use of the instructional materials to develop projects for their particular discipline and curricular needs. This site also provides resources to support educators in identifying, assigning, managing and grading mapping projects. This site includes training resources for both educators and students.

        TeachOSM is led by a volunteer steering committee based throughout the United States, and relies upon educators, students, and OpenStreetMap contributors all over the globe.
